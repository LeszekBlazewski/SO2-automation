## Run

Quick recommendation, run docker-compose in separate terminal in order to see live logs and be sure when to acess gerrit :D

### **Order of scripts is important, please follow allong**

### **NOTE**

[setup_jenkins_user_on_host.sh](setup_jenkins_user_on_host.sh) will ask you for sudo permission since it needs to create jenkins user on host machine and grant him proper permissions. This is necessary to allow Jenkins spawning sibling containers (on host machine) in Pipelines so we are not playing around with dind (docker in docker).

```bash
./setup_jenkins_user_on_host.sh
docker-compose up
./setup_gerrit_repo.sh -p gerrit-http-password
```

What is `gerrit-http-password` ? Sadly in order to configure the whole stack almost all of the gerrit related configuration relays on gerrit REST API so this step has to be performed manually by providing HTTP generated password for administratior in gerrit portal.

**_Alright alright, but how do I retrive the password !_**

Simply navigate to [gerrit](http://localhost:8080) when the container is fully started (INFO com.google.gerrit.pgm.Daemon : Gerrit Code Review 3.2.3 ready in docker log of the container). Skip the plugin installation part, you should be automatically logged in as admin, top right corner settings wheel, left section HTTP Credentials, Click on GENERATE NEW PASSWORD, supply to script.

Go checkout [gerrit](http://localhost:8080) and [jenkins](http://localhost:8081) to see the magic happen !

Also clone the repo locally and push some changes to gerrit to check whether jenkins catches everthing.

**_When restarting_**

During playtime be sure to also clear docker volumes since compose uses them (to make sure you have a fresh install each time you spin up the containers)

## TO DO

1. Write instructions in readme which will guide to run the whole PoC.

### Ideas

0. Add reverse proxy in front of the containers to easily access given services on user friendly URLS. (caddy could be nice if letsencrypt (SWAG) will not work correctly for localhost)

1. On Deploy use SWAG (lets encrypt docker image) which has certbot onboard which will take care of automatic cert renewal and will provide SSL for all the urls + implement basic auth for access with secure credentials.

2. Configure Cloud section in JCasC to use docker containers as slaves (also provisioned by jenkins when needed)

# Configuration section to automate everthing

## Jenkins configuration

### 1.Install all the necessary plugins (durning Dockerfile build from plugins.txt):

- docker-workflow (for docker inside pipeline)
- workflow-aggregator (for pipelines support)
- gerrit-code-review (better alternative to gerrit trigger)

### 2.Add preconfigured multibranch pipeline to Jenkins which will have all settings setup to fetch changes by SCM from gerrit repo:

- It would be nice if Jenkins would add a multibranch project per repo automatically when new repo is created in gerrit. (JCasC maybe ?)

- If not possible configure one Job which will listen for changes from the main repo.

### 3. Automatically add admin persmissions (gerrit user) to Jenkins (need to be fetched from gerrit) [Would be nice if security credentials could be stored in JCasC config but they need to be retrieved from Gerrit by using REST API] -> this should allow jenkins job builds to post success/error messages to gerrit.

## Gerrit configuration:

### 1.For PoC use become user to not use authentication.

### 2.Durning setup automate the install of gerrit webhooks plugin (also configuration file for jenkins server is needed) -> plugin is installed automatically when using official gerrit docker image.

### 3. Automatically upload the SSH key to gerrit in order to make SSH work for the commit hook which adds ID.
